# data-science

This project demonstrates my workflow in tackling a large dataset with missing values, inconsistencies and redundant data.

The initial analysis, data cleaning and merging were performed in Python with pandas due to its flexibility, adaptability and ease of use.

The cleaned and prepared data were exported to a .csv file and imported into R.

R was used to perfom statistical analysis and to create a model which could be used to make predictions on future data, as R provides numerous statistical techniques and methods of evaluation.
