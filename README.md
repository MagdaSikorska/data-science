# data-science

This project demonstrates my workflow in tackling a large dataset with missing values, inconsistencies and redundant data.

The initial analysis, data cleaning and merging were performed in Python with pandas due to its flexibility, adaptability and ease of use.

The cleaned and prepared data were exported to a .csv file and imported into R.

R was used to perfom statistical analysis and to create a model which could be used to make predictions on future data, as R provides numerous statistical techniques and methods of evaluation.


PROJECT AIM:
This project aims to assess fuel usage by vans and trucks and to investigate potential relationships between mileage and the use of Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) as a fuel. HVO is a biofuel marketed as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, which can reduce carbon emissions by 90% and can provide more miles per gallon (mpg) than petroleum-derived diesel oil.


The data were provided by Eland Cables Ltd., Denaby Main, South Yorkshire, United Kingdom.
